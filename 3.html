<h2 class="html3-header"> This is Temi Oni's final project for 
    Design 21 and below are the thoughts she had when she heard the prompt: What
    does the future of design look like to you? </h2>
  
    <div class="html3-container">
    <div class="box1">
      <p class="thought1">In the future, design becomes more democratized
         and accessible to individuals through the use of
         !!!AI-powered design tools!!!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box2">
      <p class="thought2"> i see a combination of tools, softwares and interfaces 
        as the future of design. Maybe an iPad, computer, 3d printer combo. yayy speculative design
       </p>
    </div>
    <div class="box3">
      <p class="thought3">We are going to move towards an world where 
        technology is completely open but we have to give up our agency. The fine 
        print of my design i guess?
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="box4">
      <p class="thought4">Disguised transparency, like its gonna be 
        clear in your face but presented in ways that are vague like jargon,
        or visually 
        Democracy at the cost of privacy, agency</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box5">
      <p class="thought5">I feel like before and by reading zuboff,
        companies have kept us behind a curtain and placed much more 
        emphasis on individualism and privacy in the digital and 
        technological sphere. With a major push for more transparency,
         I do believe it’ll manifest but not in the ways that are 
         beneficial for us because in the end, no matter how much we 
         as people try to feel more equal to big tech, it’ll never happen.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box6">
      <p class="thought6">They will say that they are explicit in their 
        intentions but will tell consumers their “fine print” in digitally 
        masked ways such as unreadable text, paywalls, technological jargon.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box7">
      <p class="thought7">$$$$money first, humanity second$$$$$
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="box8">
      <p class="thought8">DSGNPOD would be a cool name</p>
